Procedure to recover from a scratched mac with main broken display

After reading documents on how recover from a totaly scratched with a broken main dsiplay, I decided to make my own procedure.
The problem is during the mac initial phase (cmd R), external display cannot be used and that was impossible to slect the correct option only available thought the main display.

So here is the steps I used with success.

You need a second mac to do the operations


- Boot the failed Mac in target mode (T) during boot
- Connect the failed mac to the other one with Thunderbolt cable
